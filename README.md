# IT 328 Final Project: Walmart Online Shopping
Project Requirement and how we fulfilled them:
- MVC pattern: We separated our files into views, model, 
styles, classes, images, and api. So we keep each file's 
purpose clear
- Routes/Leveraging Fat-Free: We use routes to access 
all our files on the website
- Clearly defined database layer: We have a database file 
that handles all database interaction.
- Data can be viewed, added, updated, and deleted: On the 
profile page, user can view their orders and info. On register
and cart page user can add a new user and new order respectively.
On profile user can update their information. On profile user 
can cancel an order.
